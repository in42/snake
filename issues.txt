when quickly pressing two arrow keys, one can reverse the direction of the
snake
E.g. Snake moving right, left direction should not be accepted.
However I can press up and left quickly to change the direction to left.
Solved.

Movement of the snake can be done in an easier way, each segment will occupy
the previous position of the preceding segment(except the head, whose
position would depend on the direction).
